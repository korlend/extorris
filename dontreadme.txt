Great trees grew all around this planet, reaching height of a few kilometres.
Those trees filled the space between them with some kind of magic, which allows even islands to float.
Trees seems to communicate with each other and according to ancient texts are sentient and have high single hive like cognition.
Around the trees were created habitats for all type of symbiotic to them creatures, which also protect their home and mercilessly destroy any living creatures around.
In the past, people used to collect fruits, nectar and trunk sap of great trees, which had great properties of nutrition and life prolongation even before they evolved.

To survive, ancient people moved from the surface to the skies, where influence of the great trees were limited.
People built big ships and discovered that even above tree crowns islands were formed, so they claimed those as their new home.
